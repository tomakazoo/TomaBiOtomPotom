# Introduction

Some time ago at my work I was given an opportunity to build a new React application and I used that opportunity to build React Bootstrap template. A base which all our future React applications can be initiated from.  This template contains the following tools/features: **Webpack, Babel, Managing state using Redux, Building Service layer with Axios,   Testing with Jest, Avoid common errors by using ESLint, use Prettier to automatically format code, Enforce Linting, Testng and prettier to be run in git Hooks,use Material UI, how to use authentication like ADAL,and many more...** The application template can be seen here and if you are interested in full codebase please contact me and I'll share it with you.
