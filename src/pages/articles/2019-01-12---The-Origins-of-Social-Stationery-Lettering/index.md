**Hello there,** for some time I‚Äôve had this idea to write about my work and verbalise my thoughts on many different topics. Writing words takes an effort. They say that there are a lot of reasons that you should write about your work. The one I like the most is to clarify my own thinking especially when it comes to the technical topics. I used to write technical blog where my ‚Äúmantra‚Äù was ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs amazing how much you don‚Äôt know when you have to explain something to someone else.‚Äù or ‚Äúif you want to master something then teach it‚Äù.  I've read somewhere that one of the "writing opportunities" or ‚Äútriggers to write‚Äù about your work is when you hit an inflection point in your career. Now I have been promoted from developer to manager and this is when I hit my inflection point üòÑ. I would like this blog to go as a series of many articles mixed between technical and non-technical subjects. Today is non-technical topic talking about team members: how we choose them, what do we expect from them and how we let them grow as software developers and humain beings through the process of working together.

Let's start with introducing my team, who we are, what we value the most, how we work together on daily basis, etc... So, we are bunch of passionate, clever (at least we would like to think that we are üòÅ), enthusiastic software engineers who loves working together and make the process of building software enjoyable. Nowadays the biggest challenge is bringing on the right team, choosing people that would be a cultural and technical fit for the team and to retain them for a longer period of time. So how we do it? First in the process when we choose people they have to go through our carefully designed screening process interwined, of course, with our gut feeling üòè. Me surviving in this industry for so long I know that problem solving is at the heart of what we do as software developers every day. So being able to reason about problem logically will produce far more value than jumping into coding right away. We teach you to ask questions, write the facts and specs on the board: diagram the problem. We value people who demonstrate a solid problem-solving process. Almost all our walls in the office are whiteboard wallsüìà.

While the technical skills are "easy" to evaluate, the personality and how one would fit the team is much more difficult. We like to spend time together on and off the work therefore this implies that the "new" person should be having similar values outside of the work and most definitely the same sense of humorüëª. Based on this and our above-mentioned gut feeling we've been so far successfull in choosing our work colleagues.

Software development changes fast and this is a well-known fact like the gravity. Technology shifts. Inovations happen. In all this developers must take the responsibility of managing their own career. We as a company help people to learn and grow by:
+ Supporting agile methodologies through digital transformation
+ Cultivating the culture of continuous improvement
+ Ensure that the best-practices are built by sharing knowlege and replicated across the entire company

I cannot stress out enough the fact that staying current is vital but staying ahead is even more important. I personally like to teach my people the following things:
+ Never let single technology choice to monopolize your career and your knowledge.
+ Explore beyond the boundaries of what you currently know.
+ Think about future as much or more than present time.
+ Don't stagnate. This is probably the worst thing that can happen to you in our industry. If you stop and decided that you've learned everything you need to know, not only will your progress stop but you will inevitably slide backwards. While this is true for almost every aspect of life, it is particularly true when it comes to the world of software development.

When you choose to be software developer you are never done learning. üíÄ
